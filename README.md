# Dungeon Crawler

An attempt at a basic, customizable dungeon crawling game. It has a map system
already with a great number of sprites, as well as player and camera movement.

Next steps:
1. Map editor: this will allow me to much more easily construct scenarios and
   will allow users to do the same.
