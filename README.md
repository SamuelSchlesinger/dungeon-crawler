# Dungeon Crawler

An attempt at a basic, customizable dungeon crawling game. It has a map system
already with a great number of sprites, as well as player and camera movement.

## Gameplay

In this level, we have no strength, and cannot even withstand one attack, so
we must avoid the enemies and make it to the victory tile. In other levels, we
must kill all the enemies. In some levels, you can either kill all of the
enemies or make it to the tile, and sometimes you must do both.

## Future Steps

1. Map editor: this will allow me to much more easily construct scenarios and
   will allow users to do the same.
2. Procedural generation of maps.
3. User interface improvements.
